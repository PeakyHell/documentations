This guide aims to explaining in details every PC component and every parts of them.

Cores
=====

Cores are CPUs, multi-cores CPUs are just a combination of multiple CPUs.

Each core can handle a single program.

Some programs that support multithreading can use multiple cores at the same time.

More cores = More tasks at the same time.


Threads
=======

A thread is like a virtual core. Each core can be split in multiple virtual threads that can each handle a task.

Threads are useful since there are rarely programs that uses a full core's power, so being able to share that power across programs is useful.

More threads = More tasks at the same time.

Frequency
=========

The frequency of a CPU is the number of cycles per second that it can process.

A CPU with a frequency of 2GHz has 2,000,000,000 cycles per second.

More frequency = More operations per second.


Cache
=====

Accessing memory inside the RAM is slow. To avoid slowing down the CPU, it can store frequently accessed data in its cache which is a smaller but faster memory.

CPUs often have a few MBs of cache since it is very expensive.

- L1 cache is located as close to a CPU core as possible to offer the highest speed possible.
- L2 caches are physically separate from the CPU and operate slower.
- L3 caches are generally shared among multiple CPU cores.
